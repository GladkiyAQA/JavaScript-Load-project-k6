## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project was originally developed for an internal product and used for load testing.  
Because of this, some sensitive data such as **UserAgent**, **Base URL**, **Endpoints**, and certain headers are hidden and moved into configuration files (`.env`, `config/`).  

The purpose of publishing this project is to demonstrate how to work with:  
- **k6** â€” for load and performance testing.  
- **Puppeteer** â€” for working with the UI and retrieving the `sessionId`.  
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** â€” as the implementation language.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Puppeteer is Used

In this case, for the load tests to run correctly, a `sessionId` was required, which was generated by the system **only when accessing through the UI**.  

- Fetching the `sessionId` directly via API was not possible.  
- Therefore, a script was implemented using Puppeteer that opens the page, simulates a real user, and parses the `sessionId` from cookies.  
- This `sessionId` is saved into a file (`sessionId.txt`) and later used for load testing.  

The workflow looks like this:  
1. Run `runTest.js` â†’ Puppeteer opens the UI, retrieves the `sessionId`, and saves it.  
2. `runTest.js` automatically starts **k6** and passes the retrieved `sessionId`.  
3. Then the main load script `loadTest.js` executes with the chosen scenario (steady, spike, stress, etc.).

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Demonstrates

- Using **Puppeteer** for browser automation and retrieving data unavailable directly from APIs.  
- Using **k6**:  
  - Metrics (request count, errors, response times, response length).  
  - Different load testing scenarios (steady load, spike, stress, soak, mixed).  
- A project architecture with clear separation:  
  - `config/` â€” storing endpoints and headers.  
  - `scenarios/` â€” different load scenarios.  
  - `.env` â€” sensitive configuration values.  
  - Main files: `runTest.js` and `loadTest.js`.
